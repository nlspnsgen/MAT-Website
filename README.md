# MAT-Website

You're going to make a website about a topic you really enjoy. It could be a music group, a book, a film or a sports team. 

It should have 3 files:
1. index.html
2. contact.html
3. style.css
4. An image you downloaded from the internet. For example: image1.jpeg

In the index.html you should:

1. include the proper meta tags inside your <head> tags.
2. Include the css style inside your <head> tags.
3. Include a table
4. Include an image
5. include a link to your contact page


In the contact.html you should:
1. Include the proper meta tags inside your <head> tags.
2. include the css style inside your <head> tags.
3. Include some contact information (It can be fake if you don't want your data on the internet)
4. Include a link back to your index.html
